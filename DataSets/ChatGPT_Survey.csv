I hope that people will be sensible with it and it won't cause any problems but I don't think that's true as I have already seen AI-generated articles clogging up search results and AI being misused in settings where the consequences of its mistakes have been pretty serious. However, I do think it has the potential to save people a lot of time on simple jobs and help in a lot of areas.

""Generative AI tools effectively overcome language barriers in education."" - Generative AI tends to have an English language bias, unsure how this impacts the claim.
""Using Generative AI for homework does not diminish the educational value."" - it depends on its usage, within the context of computer programming Generative AI can improve productivity and effectively reduce the amount of boilerplate code which may empower the student to spend their time more efficiently on their understanding rather than rote work but it can also fill gaps in a students understanding, skipping the learning process, and resulting in worse educational outcomes.",,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat agree,Strongly disagree,Somewhat disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,"""The use of Generative AI tools in academic settings should be allowed."" - 1) Resources used in the academic process must be appropriately cited, e.g. using seaborn for data visualisation must be cited, this also holds for intermediate cases, i.e. a calculation handled in the background was performed using code written by another author, even if not directly shown in a paper, must be cited. Given this Generative AI resources must be cited, however tools like ChatGPT, due to their backbox nature, cannot be appropriately cited and hence their use in certain contexts can be seen as a form of academic misconduct. 2) Due to the technical nature of academic work transparency, honesty, and trustworthiness are important for fellow academics, and knowledge that Generative AI was used in the process can undermine that trust especially while the guidelines on academic integrity in relation to Generative AI are not common knowledge, note that this point also has an analogue w.r.t the public as the use of Generative AI in a work can lead to negative publicity. 3) given the above the use of Generative AI in an academic context is limited however it is important to not limit academic freedom, restrictions on Generative AI tools would naturally hamper the development and research of such systems and as such should not be taken. 4) In conclusion the use of Generative AI tools should be allowed but it is of great importance to promote discourse about the ethics of their use and their appropriate place in academic settings such that Academic Integrity is maintained.
""Proficiency in Generative AI tools will be crucial for competitiveness in future job markets.""/""AI will dramatically influence work, society, and daily life in the next 5 years."" - it is unclear to me if AI will have a major impact, given its potential to cause harm and job displacement such tools may end up heavily restricted in commercial contexts but based on the current trajectory, if such tools end up having prominence the result will be a net negative for society as a whole.",s2022345@ed.ac.uk,2024-03-12 13:55:02 UTC
